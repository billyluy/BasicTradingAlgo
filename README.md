# BasicTradingAlgo

This is a basic trading algorithm focused on momemtum trading.

The idea behind this project is just to dip my toes in using financal data and basic trading indicators to find possible profitable trades.

Some possible future work:
Use a Monte Carlo Simulator to help eliminate overfitting
Start paper trading using the Alpaca API
Implement a way to read news based on Ticker and run sentiment analysis to help dictate some trades
